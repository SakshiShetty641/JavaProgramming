JSHELL
-> JShell is a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
-> JShell is particularly useful for learning Java, experimenting with new features, and testing code snippets before incorporating them into larger projects.
 It provides a lightweight and interactive environment for Java developers to explore and prototype code.

 -> jhell -> To enter jshell
 -> /exit -> To exit



 Precedence

 % * / has greater precedence than  + -


 -> The eight primitives defined in Java are int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean and char.

 Main method
-> public: This keyword indicates that the main method can be accessed from anywhere. It has the most accessible level of visibility.
-> static: The main method is declared as static so that it can be called without creating an instance of the class. This means it belongs to the class itself rather than to any instance of the class.
-> void: The main method returns void, which means it does not return any value.
-> main: This is the name of the method. It is the standard name recognized by the JVM as the entry point of the program.
 String[] args: This parameter allows the main method to accept command-line arguments as an array of strings. When you run a Java program from the command line, you can pass arguments to it. These arguments are stored in the args array.


 JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode.
 JRE is a package that includes the JVM and necessary runtime libraries for running Java applications.
 JDK is a development kit that includes the JRE, development tools, and additional libraries for Java application development.

Naming Convention
Snake Case: In snake case, all letters are lowercase, and words are separated by underscores. For example: my_variable_name, this_is_snake_case.
Pascal Case: In Pascal case, also known as Upper Camel case, the first letter of each word is capitalized and there are no spaces. For example: MyVariableName, ThisIsPascalCase.
Camel Case: Camel case, or Lower Camel case, is similar to Pascal case, but the first word starts with a lowercase letter. Subsequent words start with uppercase letters. For example: myVariableName, thisIsCamelCase.
